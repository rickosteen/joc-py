#How do students in a python class compare to students from a prior semester? 
#Write a program that reads in the csv file linked above and outputs the mean,
#median, and standard deviation for the fall & spring semesters. Make sure to write
#at least two functions in your final solution. The more generalizable you make
#your code, the more you may be able to reuse it for your own project later.
#To receive feedback, please submit a screenshot of your program & its output.
#open('grades.csv', 'r')
